I decided to start new blogs on github.io. There are very few blogs on my [old site](http://arthurliao.com), which might be moved over here. (I wonder if they got any readers, though they did attract some annoying spam bots.) Some old Chinese blogs on an even older site won’t get moved, I guess.

I’m apparently a very unproductive blogger. Let’s see if blogging in Markdown makes things easier.
